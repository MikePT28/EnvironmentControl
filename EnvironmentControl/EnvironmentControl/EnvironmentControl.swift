/*  TODO List: (Not ordered by any priority)
 1.- Create another object to handle a "full cache wipe". To avoid having to unistall apps for a fresh start.
 2.- Â¿? Do we need a config init instead of modifiying the file to set the properties?
 */

/* Done:
 1.- Handle different environments in an scalable way. So more can be added in the future if needed.
 2.- Make the object a singleton.
 3.- Determine the environment to use according to the schema.
 4.- If build is the AppStore version. Force the production environment.
 5.- Do not show the extra settings on the AppStore build.
 6.- Propagate a notification if the environment changes and the config is set to NOT force restart.
